# Strategy(Policy) Design Pattern

* Many algorithm can be divided into higher and lower lever parts
* The high level algorithm will be general and can be used again and again.
* But the specific behavior can be defined as a strategy.
* Strategy pattern enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected either at runtime(dynamic) or at compile-time(static).
