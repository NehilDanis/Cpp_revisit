# Composite Desing Pattern

* Sometimes user wants to show to same behavior to a single object or to a collection of objects.
* The goal of composite pattern is to treat individual objects and the composition of objects in a uniform matter.
* One great example could be that with any drawing application, while one can manipulate drawings individually, they can also combine them as one object and manipulate them. One can move an image, or one can combine an image with some text written on it and then move the whole thing together. That is what does composite pattern do.
