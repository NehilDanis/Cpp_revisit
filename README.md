# C++ - Reviewing some content

In this repo, some basic C++ concept is implemented. This repo is for me to revisit some of the concepts from Modern C++, to design patterns with C++. The examples in this repo is mostly from the Udemy courses [1](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-advanced-c-programming/), [2](https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/) that I have watched. I am also planning to add some example from day to day coding challanges.
